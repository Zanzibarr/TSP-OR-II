    abstract = { Tabu search is a “higher level” heuristic procedure for solving optimization problems, designed to guide other methods (or their component processes) to escape the trap of local optimality. Tabu search has obtained optimal and near optimal solutions to a wide variety of classical and practical problems in applications ranging from scheduling to telecommunications and from character recognition to neural networks. It uses flexible structures memory (to permit search information to be exploited more thoroughly than by rigid memory systems or memoryless systems), conditions for strategically constraining and freeing the search process (embodied in tabu restrictions and aspiration criteria), and memory functions of varying time spans for intensifying and diversifying the search (reinforcing attributes historically found good and driving the search into new regions). Tabu search can be integrated with branch-and-bound and cutting plane procedures, and it has the ability to start with a simple implementation that can be upgraded over time to incorporate more advanced or specialized elements. }

abstract="Variable neighborhood search (VNS) is a metaheuristic for solving combinatorial and global optimization problems whose basic idea is a systematic change of neighborhood both within a descent phase to find a local optimum and in a perturbation phase to get out of the corresponding valley. In this chapter we present the basic schemes of VNS and some of its extensions. We then describe recent developments, i.e., formulation space search and variable formulation search. We then present some families of applications in which VNS has proven to be very successful: (1) exact solution of large scale location problems by primal-dual VNS; (2) generation of solutions to large mixed integer linear programs, by hybridization of VNS and local branching; (3) generation of solutions to very large mixed integer programs using VNS decomposition and exact solvers (4) generation of good feasible solutions to continuous nonlinear programs; (5) adaptation of VNS for solving automatic programming problems from the Artificial Intelligence field and (6) exploration of graph theory to find conjectures, refutations and proofs or ideas of proofs.",
